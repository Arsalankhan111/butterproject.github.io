		<h3>How are you connected to Popcorn Time?</h3>
		<p>We grabbed the code. We at the Butter Project like to work on the underlaying technologies because that is what is cool. What others use it for is not our call. We're in for the fun.</p>

		<h3>Can I use your code for my own application?</h3>
		<p>
		    Yes, you can. Butter is designed for easy forking, you probably won't have to change the core a lot (if you do, send us the patches). Keep in mind that Butter is GPL so you'll have to follow the license in the repository. You're free to do whatever you want. We might even be able to help you.
