                Being open is our core value. Our technology stack is packaged and documented, allowing the tech-savvy to be part of the deployment of world-class applications for their communities.

                Through peer-to-peer, our infrastructure costs shrink to zero as demand grows reverting the traditional growth paradigm. We have a zero trolling, censorship resistant, decentralized solution.

                We empower emerging societies and educational organisations to
                enter the video distribution race side-by-side to the biggest players by
                making user-focused tools to build solid VOD solutions, handling the whole
                media workflow with close-to-zero pre-required technical knowledge or
                infrastructures.

                Big media companies get to decide and influence how, when, where and what video is seen, destroying local contents in favor of global ones. Their centralized business models and technologies render popular content unavailable in remote areas: the cultural inclusion is bound to the Internet access, and <strong>the digital breach grows</strong>.

                Our user-owned technology makes the video content available in places with poor to no internet, we have working solutions working out of a $20 USD of-the-shelves wifi access point with a pendrive.

                We've already proven that peer-to-peer technologies can be embedded in a
                complete product for a minimal human and monetary cost. We're working with
                Governments, NGOs, small ISPs and commercial networks to build a strong
                engaged community around our vision. We feel itâ€™s very important for all
                participators to sense that the core idea of Butter makes inevitable the
                share of open-source code to many developers. Only together can we take
                Butter to the next level.
