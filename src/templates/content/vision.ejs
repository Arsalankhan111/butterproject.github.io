                Big media companies get to decide and influence how, when, where and what video is seen, destroying local contents in favor of global ones. Their centralized business models and technologies render popular content unavailable in remote areas: the cultural inclusion is bound to the Internet access, and <strong>the digital breach grows</strong>.
